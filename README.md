# Dynamic-Blog-Website
A Blogs website made using Nodejs, expressjs and ejs without any connection with a Database.

## Introduction
This website was created to practice my skills on the JS frameworks I have been working on such as Nodejs and used libraries like packages like lodash.
The website doesn't have any connection with a database such as MongoDB or MySQL and therefore cannot be used to store all the blogs that we are adding in the website.

## Install
If you are working with these frameworks for the first time and don't know how to start it on your local machine, then:
1. Fork and then clone the repo on your local machine or download the zip file.
2. Open your terminal and reach the destination folder by using cd.
3. Once you are there, type
                        npm init
  And let all the values be defaulted and set up the system.
4. Once this is done, time to install the packages, so type:
            npm install
5. When all the packages are downloaded, you can now just run the project by typing:
               node app.js
6. You can now check the project at http://localhost:3000/
